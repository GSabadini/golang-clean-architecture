<h1 align="center">Golang Clean Architecture :rocket:</h1>

## Architecture
-  The whole code is based on my view about "clean architecture" and how to build maintainable projects. If you donâ€™t know clean architecture yet, [here's](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) a reference.

## Objective

We have 2 types of users, common and merchant, both have wallet with money and make transfers between themselves.

Requirements:

- For both types of user, we need the Full Name, CPF, e-mail and Password. CPF/CNPJ and e-mails must be unique in the system. Therefore, your system should allow only one registration with the same CPF or e-mail address.

- Common users can send money (make transfers) to merchants and between common users.

- Merchant users only receive transfers, do not send money to anyone.

- Before finalizing the transfer, an external authorization service must be consulted, use this mock to simulate (https://run.mocky.io/v3/8fafdd68-a090-496f-8c9a-3442cf30dae6).

- The transfer operation must be a transaction (that is, reversed in any case of inconsistency) and the money must be returned to the sending user's wallet.

- Upon receiving payment, the common user or merchant needs to receive the notification sent by a third party service and eventually this service may become unavailable/unstable. Use this simulation to simulate sending (https://run.mocky.io/v3/b19f7b9f-9cbf-4fc6-ad22-dc30601aec04).

- This service must be RESTFul.

## Requirements/dependencies
